# LingoBuddy 🎙️

An AI-native slang learning assistant designed to bridge the gap between formal English education and real-world American conversations.

### 🚀 Overview
LingoBuddy leverages generative AI to help international students understand and practice contextual slang. This project showcases the transition from a **Figma high-fidelity prototype** to a functional, data-driven web application using modern AI-assisted development workflows.

### 🛠 Tech Stack & AI Toolkit
- **Design:** Figma (High-fidelity prototyping)
- **Development:** [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) & [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) (AI-native coding)
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (Authentication & Relational Database)
- **AI Engine:** OpenAI/Gemini API for contextualized decoding of social nuances.

### 🎓 Learning Design Principles
As a **CMU METALS** student, I integrated evidence-based learning science into the product logic:

- **Contextualized Scaffolding:** Using AI to decode social nuances and cultural context within user-provided screenshots or text, providing necessary support for comprehension.
- **Facilitating Knowledge Transfer:** Helping learners apply formal linguistic knowledge to informal, real-world conversational contexts through immediate AI-powered feedback.
- **Adaptive Personalization (Vision):** Future iterations focus on tailoring content based on the user's specific cultural background and professional goals.
